## FAQ
- ***If above download link App doesn't Install***</br>
To reduce the size of the app, I have splitted the apk according to different platform.</br>
Find your platform specific apk file from apk folder.</br>

If the app doesn't work in the background, make sure that your mobile doesn't stop the app from running in the background. [Click here to know](https://dontkillmyapp.com).</br>
